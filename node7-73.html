    In this video you are gonna learn how

to install MongoDB on a Windows computer,

so if you're using a Mac

please just mark this video as completed.<br /><br />
Now since I personally don't own any Windows computer and

this installation involves a couple of

Windows specific steps,

I asked my teaching assistant Aleksander,

to take you through the process.<br /><br />
So everyone say hi to Aleksander.<br /><br />
Hello guys my name is Aleksander and

in this lecture I will show you how

to install MongoDB on your Windows machine.<br /><br />
First you need to open your browser and

go to the MongoDB.com website,

you can see the address right here.<br /><br />
Then you need to click on products and

choose MongoDB server, okay?

Now click on this green download button.<br /><br />
And once again choose server from here.<br /><br />
Okay, now we want to install this

MongoDB Community Server and

we have a couple of options here,

so please choose the current release,

which at this point of time is the 4.0.9, okay?

As the operating system please choose Windows,

and I would just stick with this default MSI package, okay?

So after setting this up you can just hit

this download button, or

in case it doesn't work for you,

just copy the link below and

paste it in the address bar, okay?

So now we should see this pop-up that will ask you if

you want to save this file,

just click save file and

it should start downloading okay?

So I will just stop this because

I already have this file.<br /><br />
Okay? But after downloading it you can just

close the browser,

open your File Manager,

go to Downloads.<br /><br />
And you can see the installer is already there, all right?

So double click on that,

and now you should see the Setup Wizard okay?

Click next,

accept the license,

and click to install this complete version, okay?

And now it will ask you if

you want to install MongoDB as a service,

which basically means that

Mongo's server will run in the background,

so you can check this, click next.<br /><br />
It will also ask you to install MongoDB Compass,

which is the graphical user interface,

so we can also check this and click next.<br /><br />
And now just click install,

and you may see some windows pop-up that

will ask you if you want to allow this App to

be installed on your device, okay?

So in that case just click yes.<br /><br />
And now it should start the installation process,

it will take about five to ten minutes,

So I'll be right back to you after the installation.<br /><br />
All right, now just let this compass install,

okay you can see the shortcut right here,

and this is basically the compass community window,

so you can close this,

click this finish button,

and now we have two more things to do.<br /><br />
First we need to create a directory in

which MongoDB will store our data.<br /><br />
For this please open your file manager once again,

and go to the disk where MongoDB was installed,

so in my case it's Local Disk C.<br /><br />
Here create a directory called data,

so right click here,

new

folder

and call this folder Data, okay?

Now inside this data folder,

create another one called DB.<br /><br />
All right, so this is the place where

MongoDB will store our databases.<br /><br />
Now let me quickly show you that

MongoDB actually works,

so I'm going to Local Disk C,

Program Files,

find MongoDB here,

go to server,

4.0, and we are interested in this bin directory, okay?

So we can see there is a lot of files here,

but basically we are interested in this MongoD file,

which is Mongo's server and

in this Mongo.exe file which is Mongo Shell, okay?

So let me just copy the path from here and

open my console,

and by the way I'm using PowerShell but

you can also use the Command Prompt, okay?

It doesn't matter in this case.<br /><br />
So I'm using the CD commands to

go to this directory,

you can also write this DIR command to

list all the files,

and if you compare them you can see that

all these files are the same, okay?

So we are in the same bin directory.<br /><br />
And now let me just run this MongoD server,

so Mongod.exe, you can hit tab to auto complete this,

and I'm just hitting Enter and you can see that

the server is starting, okay?

So if you take a look at this line you can see that

it's waiting for connections on port 27017,

so we've basically started a server and

now we need a shell to connect to the server to

be able to manipulate our databases, okay?

So we'll be able to create databases,

delete databases,

to records, etc.<br /><br />
All right,

I will just open another PowerShell window to

demonstrate it to you.<br /><br />
And just CD to the same bin directory,

but now run this Mongo.exe, okay?

So this is the Mongo Shell,

and you can see that we've automatically connected to

the same port okay?

And now I would just run the DB command

and I should get the test database in return, okay?

And that's right.<br /><br />
So now you see that everything works, okay?

In this PowerShell we are running the server,

in this PowerShell window we've connected to the server,

okay?

And now we can just close this process using Control + C.<br /><br />
I will also close the server, okay.<br /><br />
And there is actually one more thing to do,

so what if I would like to run this Mongo server from

another directory, okay?

Let me just show it to you.<br /><br />
I will open another PowerShell window,

and now we can see that I'm currently in my user directory,

so I'm in C:\Users\Aleksander and

I want to open MongoDB server from here,

let me just write this command,

so Mongod.exe

and there is an error, okay?

So it says "The term mongod.exe is not recognized as

the name of cmdLet, function,

script file, or operable program."

So basically Windows don't know where to look for

this MongoD.exe file, okay?

So it thinks this file should be in

my user directory,

but of course this file doesn't exist here,

because it comes from MongoDB bin directory.<br /><br />
So we need to find a way to tell Windows to

look for this file in that

bin directory, okay?

And we can actually do this using system variables.<br /><br />
So let's close these windows for now,

and I will open settings,

And here in the search bar just write Env, okay?

And click on this "Edit the system environment variables"

so now you should see this small window,

it's called System Properties,

we are in the Advanced tab,

and here just click on this

Environment Variables button, okay?

And we are interested in the system variables,

Path variable, okay?

Click edit, and you can see that

there is a couple of Paths added here,

for example, I have added NodeJS and Git,

so I'm able to run Node from anywhere,

and we will add MongoDB here as well.<br /><br />
So let me just copy the Path from here,

so this is this bin directory okay.<br /><br />
And I will just create another variable here and

paste this Path here.<br /><br />
Now we can just click Okay,

once again click Okay,

you can close this window,

and let's test it in PowerShell, okay?

So you can see that I'm currently in my user directory,

and I will run MongoD.exe once again.<br /><br />
And you can see that everything works just fine, okay?

So the server is running on the same port as before

and it's ready to use, all right?

So you can close this,

and this is all.<br /><br />
So we've installed MongoDB and MongoDB Compass on

our Windows computer,

we've created a directory called Data to

store our databases,

and we've also added MongoDB to the Path,

so we are able to run MongoDB commands from

anywhere in our system.
