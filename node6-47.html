    Welcome back to the next section.<br /><br />
In this one, we will finally start to build

our big course project,

and the first step in this project

is to build our own API

using the most popular Node.js framework

which is called Express.<br /><br />
So, in the real world,

everyone uses something like Express

to actually build Node applications

because it makes development a lot easier and also faster.<br /><br />
Now we're still using Node.js, of course,

and everything that we learned before still applies.<br /><br />
We simply have an easier way of writing Node code,

and so that's obviously a big win.<br /><br />
So this section is a really exciting one,

and so let's get started.
