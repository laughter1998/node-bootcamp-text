    Another nice small feature

that we can add to an API is

to provide an alias route to a request

that might be very popular,

so it might be requested all the time.<br /><br />
And, for example, we might want

to provide a route specifically

for the five best cheap tours.<br /><br />
So, if we'd use our regular route here

with the filters and with all the features

that we already have,

the request would look a little bit like this.<br /><br />
So, let's get ride of all of this.<br /><br />
So, the five best and cheapest tours.<br /><br />
So, that means we have a limit of five

and then we're gonna sort by ratings and by price.<br /><br />
So, sort and then the average rating,

and descending, so minus ratings average.<br /><br />
And, in case they have the same average,

then we want the cheapest price possible.<br /><br />
And so, we're gonna sort also by price.<br /><br />
Let's quickly take a look at the results.<br /><br />
And, indeed, we get five tours here.<br /><br />
And, Postman does this scrolling again.<br /><br />
So, we have tours with 4.9,

4.9, 4.9 again,

4.8, and 4.7.<br /><br />
And so, these are actually our five best and cheapest tours.<br /><br />
If we said cheapest and best, well,

then maybe we would have to sort by price first

because some of them are not really cheap.<br /><br />
For example, this one.<br /><br />
But, we selected, first, the average.<br /><br />
And so, we sorted by the highest average first

and, only then in case of a tie, basically,

only then, by the price.<br /><br />
Now, let's say that this is a request

that is done all the time and we want

to provide a route that is simple

and easy to memorize for the user.<br /><br />
So, let's go to our app and try to implement that.<br /><br />
And, we're gonna start at their routes, so tour router.<br /><br />
And, we then need to create a new route.<br /><br />
And, let's do that here, right at the top.<br /><br />
So, router.route.<br /><br />
And so, how are we gonna call this route?

Well, let's say top-5-cheap.<br /><br />
So, quite a simple name, but it's gonna work.<br /><br />
And then, we actually only want

to get requests to this route.<br /><br />
And so, now it's time to think.<br /><br />
How are we gonna implement this functionality?

Well, in essence, what we want is

to actually still get all the tours just like here.<br /><br />
And so, let me go ahead and start by copying

and pasting that here.<br /><br />
So, we really still want to use this function here

because it doesn't really make sense

to rewrite all of the logic that is in there.<br /><br />
But, before we can call this route ender,

we basically want to prefill some of the fields

in the query string.<br /><br />
So, we already know

that our query string should look like this.<br /><br />
And, actually we can add some more stuff here.<br /><br />
But, in essence, our query string

has to look something like this.<br /><br />
And so, the solution is gonna be to run a middleware

before we actually run this getAllTours handler.<br /><br />
And so, that middleware function is then

gonna manipulate the query object that's coming in.<br /><br />
And so, this is yet another really nice example

of using middleware because you really need

to get familiar and used to this concept

of using middleware strategically in order

to change the request object as we need it.<br /><br />
So, let's add it here then.<br /><br />
So, tourController.<br /><br />
And then, the middleware function

that we're gonna create in a second,

which is gonna be called aliasTopTours.<br /><br />
So, let's copy that name, move to the tourController

and I'm gonna put it here at the very top.<br /><br />
So, exports.,

then request,

response,

and what's the third argument

that we need in the middleware, remember?

And, I know the Express section is kind of far away already

at this point, but I hope you remember

that the third argument here needs to be next.<br /><br />
So, in order to call the next middleware

that's in the middleware stack.<br /><br />
Give it a save.<br /><br />
And so, this error there should disappear.<br /><br />
And so, let's do what we said we would do.<br /><br />
So, basically to manipulate the query object

so that when it reaches the getAllTours handler,

it's then already different.<br /><br />
So, let's first do that and then really

take a look at what happens.<br /><br />
So, remember, the limit is gonna be set to five.<br /><br />
And, remember that everything is strings here

and so I'm setting this also to a string.<br /><br />
Now, what else did we had?

So, we have this sort, so let's just copy this here

and say req.query.sort.<br /><br />
It should be this.<br /><br />
And then, we can actually also specify some fields

so that the user doesn't get all of the fields

that we have in there.<br /><br />
So, let's say that we only want the name, the price,

the ratings average, the summary,

and the difficulty.<br /><br />
Give it a save and now all we need is next,

otherwise this middleware will be stuck here forever

and cannot move on.<br /><br />
So, let's now figure out a bit better

what's actually gonna happen here.<br /><br />
So, as soon as someone hits the top-5-cheap route,

we will start.<br /><br />
The first middleware that's gonna be run is aliasTopTours.<br /><br />
So, the function that we just created.<br /><br />
So, what this is gonna do is

that it will set these properties of the query object

to these values that we specified here.<br /><br />
Basically prefilling parts of the query object

before we then reach the getAllTours handler.<br /><br />
And so, as soon as we then get to this function,

the query object is already prefilled,

even if the user didn't put any

of these parameters in the query string.<br /><br />
And so, in essence,

what we're doing here is prefilling the query string

for the user so that the user doesn't have

to do it on his own.<br /><br />
And so, let's now actually go ahead and try this.<br /><br />
So, I'm copying this.<br /><br />
And, here it's not tours.<br /><br />
It is top-5-tours.<br /><br />
Whoa, what's going on here?

For some reason, it doesn't find this route,

so let's go back.<br /><br />
So, top-5-tours.<br /><br />
And so, here in the route, ah, okay.<br /><br />
It's called top-5-cheap,

so my mistake here.<br /><br />
So, cheap, send it now,

and that's still not correct.<br /><br />
Ah, yeah.<br /><br />
Of course, I still have to put the tours here, of course.<br /><br />
So, we are in the tours resource

and the whole router is mounted

onto this tours route, remember that.<br /><br />
And so, it's in that tours,

that kind of mini application, remember that,

where I created this top-5-cheap route.<br /><br />
So, let's hope it works now.<br /><br />
And, indeed, it does.<br /><br />
So, that worked, that's fantastic.<br /><br />
Now, of course, we could do a lot more alias routes here,

but that's not really necessary.<br /><br />
I really just wanted to show you the concept,

show you that it can be a nice feature

to add to any API and also I wanted to, again,

show you the power of middlewares.<br /><br />
So, we're talking about Mongoose here,

but still, it's very important to keep getting familiar

with the Express concepts that we talked about before.<br /><br />
Anyway, we're now done with our API features.<br /><br />
In the next video, we're just gonna quickly refactor all

of this to make the entire code a bit more modular

and, of course, better.
