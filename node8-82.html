Welcome back to yet another really exciting section,

where we will finally connect a MongoDB database

with our application.<br /><br />
And to do so, we're gonna use the very popular

Mongoose library, which makes working with MongoDB

in Node.js, really, really easy.<br /><br />
So in this section, we're gonna take a deep dive

into the Mongoose library,

and really make our application

and API come to life with real data

coming from a real database.<br /><br />
So we're gonna talk about data models,

implement important API features,

add some data validation,

and also use the advanced MongoDB aggregation pipeline.<br /><br />
So, get ready now for a ton of great content coming up.<br /><br />
