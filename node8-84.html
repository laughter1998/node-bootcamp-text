    So, we connected our application

with the database using Mongoose in the last lecture.<br /><br />
But wait, what actually is Mongoose?

Well, Mongoose is an object data modeling library

for MongoDB and Node JS,

providing a higher level of abstraction.<br /><br />
So, it's a bit like the relationship

between Express and Node,

so Express is a layer of abstraction over regular Node,

while Mongoose is a layer of abstraction

over the regular MongoDB driver.<br /><br />
And by the way, an object data modeling library

is just a way for us to write JavaScript code

that will then interact with a database.<br /><br />
So, we could just use a regular MongoDB driver

to access our database, and it would work just fine,

but instead we use Mongoose,

because it gives us a lot more functionality out of the box,

allowing for faster and simpler development

of our applications.<br /><br />
So, some of the features Mongoose give us

is schemas to model our data and relationship,

easy data validation, a simple query API,

middleware, and much more.<br /><br />
In Mongoose, a schema is where we model our data,

so where we describe the structure of the data,

default values, and validation.<br /><br />
We then take that schema and create a model out of it.<br /><br />
And the model is basically a wrapper

around the schema, which allows us to actually interface

with the database in order to create, delete, update,

and read documents.<br /><br />
All right, so this was just a very quick introduction.<br /><br />
Now, let's actually go ahead

and create a simple schema and model.
