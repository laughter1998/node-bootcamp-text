    Let's now keep working on our API.<br /><br />
Over the next videos, we will implement

a couple of common API features

that make an API easier and more pleasant to use

for whomever is gonna use it.<br /><br />
And in this lecture,

we're gonna start with filtering.<br /><br />
So again, the first feature that we're gonna implement

is to allow the user to basically filter data

using a query string.<br /><br />
Let me just tell you what a query string is using Postman.<br /><br />
So, let's close all these guys.<br /><br />
Alright.<br /><br />
Actually where filtering is gonna make sense

is here on this get all tours route.<br /><br />
Because, this is the one that,

well as the name says, gets all the tours.<br /><br />
And so here, we want to allow the user to filter the data,

so that instead of getting all the data,

he only gets the data that matches the filter.<br /><br />
Like this, we can basically allow the user

to query the data in a very easy way.<br /><br />
Again, using the query string.<br /><br />
And the query string looks a bit like this.<br /><br />
And I'm sure you've seen it.<br /><br />
So we start with a question mark,

and then we can simply specify some field value pairs.<br /><br />
So let's say we wanted to filter

for a duration equal to five and

at the same time, a difficulty of easy.<br /><br />
So we can very simply build a query string like this.<br /><br />
So again, it starts with this question mark,

and then we can specify as many

key value pairs using this format.<br /><br />
And now our Postman application here

actually recognizes this and basically

parses this string here and puts the key and

the values down here in this Params tab.<br /><br />
So we could also specify the key and values here.<br /><br />
So lets say test, set it to twenty three, and

so you see up here that it actually

added it to the query string.<br /><br />
So that's a very nice way of Postman helping us here.<br /><br />
Because now we can, for example, while we're

doing testing we can turn these on and off

and you see that the query string

in here reacts accordingly.<br /><br />
Anyway, we now need a way of accessing this data

that's in a query string, in our Express application.<br /><br />
But, luckily for us, that's very easy,

because Express already took care of that.<br /><br />
So that's just one of the many many things

that Express does for us in order to really make

NodeJS development a lot faster.<br /><br />
So let me show it to you here, actually in the console.<br /><br />
So this data is on a request, which makes sense,

and then it is in a field called query.<br /><br />
So request dot query should then give us

an object nicely formatted with the data

from the query string.<br /><br />
Give it a save.<br /><br />
And note, how I actually added it to

the get all tours handler function.<br /><br />
So again, we do this kind of filtering

in the route where we want to get all the tours.<br /><br />
Let's test it out now with this exact query string.<br /><br />
Sent the request.<br /><br />
And coming back, here we got the object.<br /><br />
Let's actually make this here bigger

so you can see.<br /><br />
That's not really working.<br /><br />
So sometimes I know some people cannot see

the bottom of the screen.<br /><br />
Let me just do it again here.<br /><br />
And so, here we go.<br /><br />
We have the object, which has the duration set to five

and the difficulty set to easy.<br /><br />
And so you see that Express, very nicely,

parsed that string into this, easy to use, object.<br /><br />
Now one thing that I noticed here is that

we're actually missing the log that we had

easier here in the console.<br /><br />
Let's take a look at why that's happening.<br /><br />
So for some reason, we now have the application

before we actually read the environment variable.<br /><br />
That way, the application does not get access to them.<br /><br />
I thought that I had fixed this before,

but for some reason it's back now.<br /><br />
Give it another save here.<br /><br />
And I will try that again.<br /><br />
Now we get our logging back.<br /><br />
A get request to this URL and then with

this rest of the data here.<br /><br />
Anyway, let's now actually use that data

in order to implement our filtering.<br /><br />
But before we can do that, I need to tell you that

in Mongoose, there are actually two ways of

writing database queries.<br /><br />
The first one is to just use filter object

just like we did in the MongoDB introduction section.<br /><br />
Right? Remember that?

The second way is to use some special Mongoose methods.<br /><br />
Let me just, very quickly, show that to you.<br /><br />
With the filter object, we would do it like this.<br /><br />
We start with the find here, and then in there

we can pass a filter object.<br /><br />
And I already mentioned that before.<br /><br />
Again, it works the exact same way as

with a normal MongoDB query.<br /><br />
We could now say, duration

set it to five.<br /><br />
And then,

difficulty, set it to easy.<br /><br />
That's exactly the query string we had before,

and now I'm hard coding it here just to

show you the two different ways of

writing queries in Mongoose.<br /><br />
Let's test this one out.<br /><br />
You see that now, we only get two results.<br /><br />
Let's give ourselves some space here.<br /><br />
Alright.<br /><br />
We see the two results and indeed

they both have a duration of five,

so here and here, and they both are easy.<br /><br />
Easy and easy.<br /><br />
So our filter worked just fine.<br /><br />
That is the first way of writing a query.<br /><br />
Just the normal way that we're already used to,

but there is another way.<br /><br />
Let me show that to you as well.<br /><br />
Again, we start in the exact same way,

but then the difference is that we start

chaining some special Mongoose method to

basically build the query similar to this one that we have.<br /><br />
So we say,

where

the duration

equals five.<br /><br />
Then also, where

the difficulty,

that needs to be in quotes,

equals

easy.<br /><br />
This query here is gonna be exactly

the same as this one, but again, written using

special Mongoose methods.<br /><br />
And there are of course tons of other methods.<br /><br />
For example, instead of equals, we can have less than,

or equal, or just less than, or you can also

sort the results or limit the number of results,

and really all kinds of stuff.<br /><br />
For sure, we're gonna use some of them

over the next couple of videos.<br /><br />
This might look a bit weird here to you,

but its actually very, very useful in some cases.<br /><br />
Just to test, give it a try again to this one.<br /><br />
And indeed we get our same two results.<br /><br />
Now, let me comment this one here out.<br /><br />
I'm gonna leave it here just as a reference,

because right now, we're gonna use this method here.<br /><br />
And we're gonna use it, because in fact,

we actually already have an object that

looks a lot like this.<br /><br />
And that is request dot query.<br /><br />
If you compare it, this object,

to this object that you see down here,

looks exactly the same as this one.<br /><br />
To implement a very simple filter,

all we have to do in this case is to say, req dot query.<br /><br />
Let's try that one more time.<br /><br />
Get rid of this here.<br /><br />
And indeed we get the exact same two results.<br /><br />
Now let's just try only with difficulty set to easy.<br /><br />
Now we get four results.<br /><br />
All of them of course will have

the difficulty set to easy.<br /><br />
Our filter, our very basic filter,

is now actually working.<br /><br />
Now, the problem with this implementation,

is that its actually way too simple.<br /><br />
That's because, later on, we will have

other query parameters.<br /><br />
For example, sort, for sorting functionality,

or page, for pagination.<br /><br />
We need to make sure that we are

not querying for these in our database.<br /><br />
For example, if we added here,

page, equal to two,

then we would, of course, not get any result.<br /><br />
Let me show that to you.<br /><br />
And indeed we do not get any result,

because there is no document in this collection

where page is set to two.<br /><br />
We only want to use this parameter here,

or this field, page, to implement pagination

and not to actually query in the database.<br /><br />
So what we will have to do is,

to basically exclude these special field names

from our query string before we actually do the filtering.<br /><br />
Let's now go ahead and implement that.<br /><br />
What we will do is, to first, create a

shallow copy of the request dot query object.<br /><br />
Let's call it query object.<br /><br />
Here we need, really, a hard copy.<br /><br />
We can't just do, request dot query,

because then, if you would delete something

from this object, we would also delete it

from the req dot query object.<br /><br />
And that's because in JavaScript,

when we set a variable to another object,

that new variable will basically just be

a reference to that original object.<br /><br />
So we really need a hard copy here.<br /><br />
In JavaScript, there's not really a built-in way

of doing this, but a very nice trick that we can use,

since ES6, is to use, first, the structuring

which we use by using dot dot dot.<br /><br />
And then we can simply create a

new object out of that.<br /><br />
Just like this.<br /><br />
This structuring here, these three dots,

will basically take all the fields out of the object.<br /><br />
Here with the curly braces, well,

we simply create a new object.<br /><br />
So we have a new object that is basically

going to contain all the key value pairs

that were in our req dot query object.<br /><br />
So that's a copy.<br /><br />
Now let's create an array of

all the fields that we want to exclude.<br /><br />
I'm calling that one excluded fields.<br /><br />
And then we want to exclude page,

so that's the one that I just

told you before in Postman.<br /><br />
Then, we also want to exclude

sort,

we want to exclude limit,

and we want to exclude fields.<br /><br />
We will implement all of the functionality

of paging, sorting, limiting, and selecting

only some specific fields, later

over the next couple of videos.<br /><br />
Next, what we need to do is to

basically remove all of these fields

from our query object.<br /><br />
And in order to do that, we will

loop over these fields.<br /><br />
So, excluded fields

for each.<br /><br />
And we're using for each because

we don't want to save a new array.<br /><br />
Then each of these of elements,

we can use the delete operator.<br /><br />
And then from the query object,

we want to delete the field with

the name of element, so the current

element in the array.<br /><br />
Like this, we will first delete the field of page,

then the sort, then the limit, then the fields.<br /><br />
Of course, only in case if its there.<br /><br />
If there is, for example, no limit field,

then, of course, that will not be deleted,

because its not there.<br /><br />
Let's now take a look if this actually works.<br /><br />
I'm gonna log req dot query and

at the same time our query object.<br /><br />
Giving this a save.<br /><br />
Don't worry about our results now.<br /><br />
All I want to take a look at is

our query object, just to make sure

that this logic that we have here actually works.<br /><br />
Let's add a sort here of one and a limit of 10.<br /><br />
These will make more sense later.<br /><br />
For now, I am just adding them,

so that I can later exclude them.<br /><br />
Results don't matter, all that matters,

is that our original query is this one here,

and then our query object, which is

the one that we're going to use,

only has difficulty set to easy.<br /><br />
That's because we excluded, page, sort, and limit.<br /><br />
This now works, so instead of using

req dot query, we're gonna use our query object.<br /><br />
Let's get rid of that and try it again.<br /><br />
Now we should be back to querying for

all the documents that have a difficulty

set to easy and ignoring all of these other fields.<br /><br />
Send that.<br /><br />
And indeed, we are back to our four

results that we had before.<br /><br />
We can also turn on the duration,

and indeed, we will now have two results.<br /><br />
Remember that?

And if we turn these off,

well, then off course its gonna work the same.<br /><br />
Let's just delete this empty line here.<br /><br />
And so, indeed, with our original query string,

things obviously also still worked the same.<br /><br />
We prepared our filter feature so that it

ignores page, sort, and limit fields.<br /><br />
But there is actually something more we need

to do in our code, in order to basically

be able to implement these features in future videos.<br /><br />
Let's go back here to our code.<br /><br />
So let's now learn a little bit

about how queries actually work in Mongoose.<br /><br />
I think I mentioned this before,

but its very important to talk about this again.<br /><br />
This find method here is going to return a query.<br /><br />
All of this here will return a query.<br /><br />
And that is the reason why we can then

chain other methods like this.<br /><br />
Like where, equals, and all these other methods

that I talked to you about before.<br /><br />
Let me actually show that to you in the documentation again.<br /><br />
Here we have the query object,

and again, when we use the find method,

it will return an object which is a query.<br /><br />
So in query dot prototype,

we then have all of these methods.<br /><br />
For example, down here we have where,

which I just mentioned.<br /><br />
We have sort which is the one

that were gonna use later to sort.<br /><br />
We have, let's see, we have less than

or less than equal, we have greater.<br /><br />
We have...<br /><br />
What else did we use?

We used equals.<br /><br />
All of these are part of query dot prototype.<br /><br />
Which, again, refers to objects that

we're creating using the query class.<br /><br />
Again, this is the reason why

we can do this sort of chaining.<br /><br />
Now comes the important part.<br /><br />
As soon as we actually await the

result of the query, so as soon as

we use await here or here, for example.<br /><br />
As soon as we use this await,

the query will then execute and

come back with the documents that

actually match our query.<br /><br />
If we do it like this, such as we have here,

then there is now way of, later,

implementing sorting, or pagination,

or all of these other features.<br /><br />
Instead, what we will have to do,

is to save this part here into a query,

then in the end, as soon as we change all the methods

to the query that we need to, only then

by the end, we can await that query.<br /><br />
For example, we're going to use the sort method.<br /><br />
We're going to use the predict method,

we're going to use the limit method,

and we're going to use, really, a bunch of methods,

and chain them to this query.<br /><br />
That would be impossible to do,

again, if we await the result of

this initial query here, right away.<br /><br />
I hope that made sense.<br /><br />
The way that we will do it

is that we

will have our tours down here.<br /><br />
And this will await the query.<br /><br />
The query is, well, simply the

query without any await.<br /><br />
Just to make it consistent with

this part here,

let's do it like this.<br /><br />
Let's say that,

first, we build the query

and then we execute the query.<br /><br />
That's not correct.<br /><br />
Since we're doing comments here,

let's also say send

response.<br /><br />
Just to make our code a bit more easy to scan.<br /><br />
I hope that all of this made sense,

this turned out to be quite a long video,

but it was important to finish

this part here by explaining you

this logic here, so that in the next videos,

we will then be able to implement

the rest of the features.<br /><br />
Because, again, without having it

like this, it would not work.
