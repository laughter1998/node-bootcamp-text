    No Need to Install MongoDB Locally
You don't need to install MongoDB on your computer
There have been some problems with installing MongoDB locally, because things change quite frequently.<br /><br />
The truth is, you don't need to install MongoDB in order to go through this course and to build most apps.<br /><br />
You can just use a hosted MongoDB instance using a service called Atlas, as I will teach you in Lecture 80.<br /><br />
This means you can skip Lectures 72-78 (79 is relevant for installing the Compass app).<br /><br />
Happy learning! ✌️
