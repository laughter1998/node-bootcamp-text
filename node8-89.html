    So you already learnt

how to create new documents in the database.<br /><br />
But in this lecture I'm going to show you

an easier and even better way of doing so,

as we implement our create tour handler.<br /><br />
So at this point our API

basically doesn't do anything anymore.<br /><br />
It doesn't work anymore

because basically we deleted all the functionality

that we had in the last video.<br /><br />
And we did so, so that over the next couple of lectures

we can rebuild it using a real database.<br /><br />
Okay, so basically finally building our real API.<br /><br />
And we're gonna start by implementing

the createTour function.<br /><br />
But just remember the handler function

that is called as soon as there is a post request

to the tours route.<br /><br />
So that's what we have here in tourRoutes.<br /><br />
So let's put that here.<br /><br />
So what I just said is this.<br /><br />
So we have this checkBody here.<br /><br />
Which actually is something

that we will be able to delete as well.<br /><br />
So where is that, actually?

checkBody

alright, so this is yet another of these functions

that we really don't need anymore.<br /><br />
Because this was basically to validate the body.<br /><br />
So to see if it had the name or the price property in them.<br /><br />
Right?

But now our mongoose model

is actually gonna take care of that.<br /><br />
And so again, this here was nice

to actually show us how middle-ware works

but now we can get rid of it.<br /><br />
Okay, and so I'm gonna delete it from here as well.<br /><br />
Give it a new save.<br /><br />
And it's now back to working.<br /><br />
Anyway the function that we're creating now

is this createTour function.<br /><br />
Where just the one data is going to get called

as soon as someone hits the tour route with a post request.<br /><br />
Okay, so just to recap that

because I know that it can be a bit confusing

with these different files and different folders

and different functions.<br /><br />
But it's also really important

that we start organizing our code

right from the beginning.<br /><br />
Okay?

Anyway, we are here in the createTour function.<br /><br />
And so let's now actually create a new tour.<br /><br />
And we're gonna do that based on the data

that comes in from the body.<br /><br />
Remember that?

Now remember how we used to create documents

a couple of lectures ago.<br /><br />
So we did it like this.<br /><br />
For example let's say newTour

then equal to newTour

and then the data in there.<br /><br />
So we did it like this and then that's a new tour.<br /><br />
And then we type newTour.save

and that works kinda fine.<br /><br />
But we can do it in an even easier way.<br /><br />
So instead of doing this we can do

Tour.create and then paste the data in there.<br /><br />
Okay and that will do the exact same thing.<br /><br />
The main difference is that in this version here

we basically call the method directly on the tour

while in this first version we called the method

on the new document.<br /><br />
Okay, and so that is completely different.<br /><br />
So again we had the tour that we created

from the model.<br /><br />
And then on that tour we used the save method.<br /><br />
Because the document has access to this method

and a lot of other methods as well.<br /><br />
But here in the second situation

we call this create method right on the model itself, okay?

Now remember how this save method here returned a promise.<br /><br />
And so this create here does return a promise as well.<br /><br />
And so in order to get access to the file document

as it was created in the database,

we would then to have used .then okay?

But instead of using promises like this,

I'm gonna start using async await.<br /><br />
Alright.<br /><br />
So this function here should be an async function.<br /><br />
So all we need to do

is to write async right here.<br /><br />
So we have async and so we can now await the result

of this promise here.<br /><br />
So I hope you are familiar with this.<br /><br />
And I actually have a section in this course

that deals with exactly this kind of stuff.<br /><br />
So if you didn't watch that section

but are still not 100% familiar with async await

then please go ahead and watch that section

so that you really understand what's going on here.<br /><br />
Okay, so instead of using this then here

I'm gonna use async await

and then save the result value of this promise

in the new tour variable.<br /><br />
Okay, now the final piece of the puzzle here

is to of course pass some real data into this create method.<br /><br />
And so instead of this empty object

we're gonna pass in the request body

so req.body and so that's the data

that comes with the post request, right?

Now just one more time,

just to make sure that everything is clear to you.<br /><br />
Okay so we can use the tour model directly

and call the create method on it.<br /><br />
Then into that function we pass the data

that we want to store in the database as a new tour.<br /><br />
And that data comes from the post body, right?

And so that's stored inside of request dot body.<br /><br />
So this variable here.<br /><br />
Now this method here will then return a promise.<br /><br />
And we await that promise using async await

and then store that result into the newTour variable

which will be the newly created document

already with the ID and everything, okay?

So I'm gonna keep this code here

just as a reference.<br /><br />
And for now let's get this piece of data here back.<br /><br />
Piece of code actually.<br /><br />
Give it a save.<br /><br />
And now we get this ES lint error.<br /><br />
So let's take a look at that

just put our mouse on here.<br /><br />
And it tells us that async functions are not supported

until this node 7.6

and so this ES lint error comes from that node plugin

that we actually installed.<br /><br />
So you can see that here.<br /><br />
Alright, so what we're gonna to do fix this

is to simple go to package.json

and in here you find the node version

that we are actually using.<br /><br />
So that's very simple.<br /><br />
We just need to specify the engines property

here in our json document.<br /><br />
And set node to greater or equal

than 10.<br /><br />
Okay, and that's because in this course

we are using at least node ten.<br /><br />
So 7.6 would be enough in order to make that error disappear

but of course we specify the real version

that we're actually using.<br /><br />
So we give this one a save.<br /><br />
Close that up.<br /><br />
And so now our error here is actually gone.<br /><br />
Now just one more step before we can actually try this out

in our Postman app.<br /><br />
And that is that we actually need to handle errors.<br /><br />
Okay, and so keep in mind that with async await

we need to test for errors using the try catch syntax.<br /><br />
So we write a try block.<br /><br />
Then wrap all our code in there.<br /><br />
And then finally a catch block.<br /><br />
Which as we already know has access to the error object.<br /><br />
And now what do we actually put here?

Well we need to think about

when exactly an error can happen.<br /><br />
So remember like two lectures ago

when we were creating our first documents.<br /><br />
We got an error back then

when we tried to create a document

without one of the required fields, right?

And so that was a validation error.<br /><br />
And it's one of the errors that would get catched here.<br /><br />
Okay because if we tried to create a document

let's say without one of the required fields

then this promise that is created here

would be rejected, okay?

And so if we have a rejected promise here

then it will enter the catch block.<br /><br />
And so therefore, basically in this catch block here

we want to send back a response

saying that there was an error.<br /><br />
Alright so res.status here again

and 400 which stands for bad request.<br /><br />
.json

and now something very similar to this one

but its status and that's fail

and then instead of data here we send a message

and for now lets just set the message to the error.<br /><br />
Alright.<br /><br />
And let's now finally get back to our Postman application

and give this a try.<br /><br />
Okay, so create this one

and let's now create a new tour.<br /><br />
So right now here we have

the name duration difficulty and price

and so let's actually also add the rating

and that needs to be in double quotes

4.7.<br /><br />
Alright, and now comes the moment.<br /><br />
Send and indeed here we go.<br /><br />
So this is the tour

that we just created.<br /><br />
We have our rating.<br /><br />
We have our name and we have our price.<br /><br />
And of course the automatically created ID.<br /><br />
Now you might notice

that we have no difficulty and no price.<br /><br />
Well why do you think that is?

Well that's because these two fields

are actually not in our schema

and so therefore they are not put in the database.<br /><br />
So everything else that is not in our schema

is simply ignored.<br /><br />
So that is the power of our schema, alright?

Great, now let's actually try to send this again

and so that should give us an error, right?

And indeed there we go.<br /><br />
We have our 400 bad request.<br /><br />
And we have this message

which is the complete error that we got.<br /><br />
And so here we see that the error message is duplicate key.<br /><br />
And so that's because we already have the Test Tour 2.<br /><br />
And so it could not create another one.<br /><br />
So let's just create another one here like Jonas Tour.<br /><br />
It doesn't really matter, okay?

I just wanna create it,

first without any of this

just to see if we get another error.<br /><br />
And indeed we get some more errors here.<br /><br />
This time saying that

that the tour validation failed

because a tour must have a price.<br /><br />
Okay, so you see that right now we have

this kind of weird error structure here.<br /><br />
So Mongo DB gives back this huge complete error object.<br /><br />
And later on we're actually gonna take care of that.<br /><br />
So we will have an entire section on error handling alone.<br /><br />
And by then we will create some more meaningful errors.<br /><br />
Okay, for now let's just replace this error object

with some normal string here.<br /><br />
So let's say invalid data sent.<br /><br />
Okay, so don't do something like this

in a real production application

but again we're gonna have some real error handling

a bit later which is gonna take care of that.<br /><br />
Okay, so displaying meaningful errors to the client.<br /><br />
So let's just go back here

send it again.<br /><br />
And so now we get this normal string here.<br /><br />
So let's just create the price here.<br /><br />
Let's set it to 567

then send it.<br /><br />
And so now you will see

that our default rating here is actually still working.<br /><br />
Let's now figure all of this out in compass as well.<br /><br />
And indeed we get our four tours in the database.<br /><br />
So all these weird tests

that we've been doing up until this point.<br /><br />
So let's just go ahead and delete these last two.<br /><br />
That were really just for testing.<br /><br />
Alright.<br /><br />
So something went wrong here I guess.<br /><br />
Okay, now we're back to these two.<br /><br />
Let's now just create the third one

that we actually had before in the last section.<br /><br />
Which is the Snow Adventurer.<br /><br />
So the Snow

Adventurer.<br /><br />
The price was ...<br /><br />
I'm not sure anymore

like 697 maybe.<br /><br />
And the rating is like six

or actually 4.8.<br /><br />
Sent that guy.<br /><br />
And so indeed here we go.<br /><br />
Great.<br /><br />
Just to quickly recap our createTour function.<br /><br />
So we have a try catch here

because we're actually using an async await function here.<br /><br />
Right, so we use async await

because this tour.create returns a promise

that we're awaiting so that we can then store

the newly created tour document

inside of this variable

and then send it along with the response

to the client down here.<br /><br />
Okay but in case there is an error,

like a validation error for example

then that error is gonna be catched

and we send something else back to the client

with this error message.<br /><br />
So this is how we create documents using mongoose.<br /><br />
Next up we're gonna talk about reading documents.
