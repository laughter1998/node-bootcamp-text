    Finally, let's learn

how to delete documents in MongoDB.<br /><br />
So just like before,

we have delete one to delete one single document,

and we have delete many, well,

to delete multiple documents at the same time.<br /><br />
Alright, and just like before,

delete one will only work

for the first document matching your query.<br /><br />
And delete many will of course

work for all the documents matching your query.<br /><br />
Okay.<br /><br />
Just to get an overview of what we have here

at this moment in time,

let's do a find of all the tours.<br /><br />
And what I'm gonna do now

is to delete all the tours

which have a rating less than 4.8.<br /><br />
So that's gonna be just the first one

but if we had multiple tours with that condition,

then all of them would be deleted.<br /><br />
So db.tours.deleteMany.<br /><br />
So the condition is rating...<br /><br />
Open a new object

so that we can use the less than operator and 4.8.<br /><br />
Close it and then close this one.<br /><br />
And run this and here we see that it's deleted one document.<br /><br />
Right away it's telling us here

how many documents were affected by this operation.<br /><br />
So if we do this find now,

well then the first one that we had is gone.<br /><br />
Alright, so that's no problem.<br /><br />
We are only really using this here to play around

and so we can delete as much as we want here.<br /><br />
No problem.<br /><br />
Now if you wanna delete

all of the documents in the collection,

you would do it like this.<br /><br />
So deleteMany.<br /><br />
And I'm not gonna execute this.<br /><br />
But you would do it like this.<br /><br />
So all you have to do is pass in the empty object

because the empty object is basically a condition

that all of the documents always match.<br /><br />
It would be like simply using an empty object here in find.<br /><br />
I'm not gonna do that

and you should be careful with it,

especially when doing it in a real app

because you cannot come back from this operation.<br /><br />
So unless you have some backup in place,

this will effectively delete all the documents

in your collection,

in this case the tours collection.<br /><br />
So I'm not performing that.<br /><br />
I just wanted to show you

that this is how we delete everything.<br /><br />
So this is the simplest operation

and we don't use it all that often.<br /><br />
But I just wanted to have a short video

just to demonstrate that it also exists.
