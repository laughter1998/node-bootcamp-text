    Now before we can move on to

writing some actual express code,

we first need to install yet

another tool,

and this time it's an

app called Postman.<br /><br />
And Postman is a beautiful tool

that allows us to do API testing.<br /><br />
It's a little bit like a browser

but it doesn't render any html

or any visible websites to us.<br /><br />
Instead we can do all kinds of requests

and then receive the response simply

as text then work with that response.<br /><br />
So as they say Postman simplifies API development

and that really is true.<br /><br />
And that kind of is the standard

application that you will see everyone

using basically for testing APIs.<br /><br />
But you can do a lot more than just testing

and we will see many of these features

throughout this course.<br /><br />
For now, just head over to getpostman.com

So, as you can see here in the url

and then here on product, just hit Postman.<br /><br />
Then finally download the app,

and then download.<br /><br />
So, I'm not going to download it right now,

of course I already have it installed.<br /><br />
And so let's now take a look at how

Postman actually works.<br /><br />
So I'm going to open up Postman.<br /><br />
That takes a little time,

and so here we go this is

how Postman looks like.<br /><br />
And probably when you downloaded yours,

it's going to be in a light version,

but if you like the dark mode, like me,

just open up the settings and on themes,

you can just use the dark theme over here.<br /><br />
All right, so as I said, it's a little

bit like a browser where in here we

can enter a url and do the request.<br /><br />
Now, it does allow us to do all kinds

of requests, where in the browser

whatever we put in here in the url bar,

it's always going to be a get request.<br /><br />
But here we can change that, we can use

get or post or put or patch and all

these http methods here.<br /><br />
Where some of them we have already

talked about before, and will keep

talking about in this section. Okay?

Now just to test it very quickly,

Let's use again the dog API that we used before.<br /><br />
So that was at

dog.ceo

then dog API then let's

just simply use this url here

Okay. And so all we have to do is

to put it here, this case we really want

a get request and then send.<br /><br />
And after some time, it should

then show up down here.<br /><br />
And indeed, here we go.<br /><br />
So, that is the Json data just

as we expected it. Okay.<br /><br />
So it looks exactly like what

we have here.<br /><br />
Right?

Now we can then actually save

these requests here, and we

can create collections and folders

to organize our requests.<br /><br />
We can run automatic tests.<br /><br />
We can set up different development

environments or production environments

and all kinds of other useful stuff.<br /><br />
Like sending data in the body for

a post request or a patch request.<br /><br />
Or we can set headers or really,

all you can imagine about building APIs.<br /><br />
So from now on, in the next couple sections,

we're always going to be using

Postman to run or request.<br /><br />
Okay.<br /><br />
So this was just a very quick demo

of Postman so that starting now

we can start building our API

then test it using this tool.
