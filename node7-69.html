Hey there, this section is all about the super popular

MongoDB database system.<br /><br />
So over the next couple of videos,

you will learn how to install MongoDB on your system,

how to create databases,

how to then insert data into a database,

query data in multiple ways, and much more.<br /><br />
So, we're gonna take a step back

from the native's app in this section,

and really focus on learning just MongoDB,

which itself is actually really fun to use.<br /><br />
I really love working with this database system.<br /><br />
So without further ado, let's now move on.
