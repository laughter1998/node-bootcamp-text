    So we learned about Document

and query middleware, and now the last middleware

that we're gonna talk about is aggregation middleware,

and as you can probably guess,

aggregation middleware allows us to add hooks

before or after an aggregation happens,

and so let's now actually continue with

our previous example where we did hide the secret tours

from the queries, now in an aggregation the secret tours

are still being used, right?

So let's quickly confirm that actually,

for example here in our gets tour stats,

so that's where we used the first aggregation

and so you see we have four tours here,

four in easy, and three in medium

and so that makes 11 but we already know

that we actually only want 10 tours.<br /><br />
So there are 10 tours that are not secret,

and one that is secret, and so now we get all these

11 tours here and so basically we also want

to exclude the secret tour in the aggregation.<br /><br />
So how could we do that?

Well let's take a look at where our aggregation

is actually happening so it's down here in yeah,

so in get tour steps, and so what we could do is to here

in this match state simply exclude the secret tours

that are true right?

So that would be quite easy to add here,

but then we would have to add the same thing

down here in the other aggregation that we have,

and if we had even more aggregations we would then

have to add that in all of them and that's of course

not a good idea, because for example we could forget

to do it and it's also just repetitive code

and so let's simply exclude it right at the model level,

alright so let's add aggregation middleware here

starting with a comment.<br /><br />
So aggregation middleware and so just like before

we have tourSchema.pre so we want this to happen before

the aggregation is actually executed

and so here we use the aggregate hook.<br /><br />
Alright and then our function which again accepts

the next function so calling the next middleware.<br /><br />
Alright, so let's start by taking a look

at this, so remember that up here in query middleware

that this object points to the current query.<br /><br />
Then here in document middleware the this object

points to the current document,

and so down here in aggregation middleware

this is going to point to the current aggregation object.<br /><br />
Okay and so let's take a look at that in the console

but before that let me just remove this log here.<br /><br />
Alright give it a save, run this aggregation here

and that's taking a lot of time and so let's cancel it

and go back and that's probably because

we're not calling next here, and so like we already know

we get stuck in the middleware function

and so that's not good.<br /><br />
So let's try that again now send,

and yeah so now we're back and now let's take a look

at the aggregation object.<br /><br />
Okay so there's a lot of stuff in here

so it's not really interesting here

and I cannot really find what I'm trying to show you here

and so let's simply add this.pipeline okay because what

I really wanted to show you is just the pipeline object.<br /><br />
Okay, and actually it's pipeline like this

so it's actually a function, a method.<br /><br />
So let's clear the console here.<br /><br />
Try this again, and so here we get the aggregation pipeline,

and so that's simply the array that we passed into

the aggregate function before.<br /><br />
Right, so let's take a look and so here we have

that array, this one not this one.<br /><br />
So we have the match to group

and then the sort so if we take a look here

at the console we have indeed our match with the ratings

average we have group and then sort.<br /><br />
So that is exactly the pipeline we specified before,

and so now in order to filter out the secret tours

all we have to do is to add another match stage

right at the beginning of this pipeline array,

right and so let's do just that.<br /><br />
So let's do that here before this log,

so this.pipeline and remember that this is an array

and how do we add an element at the beginning

of an array?

We use unshift and so that is a standard JavaScript

method for arrays okay, we have also shift to add

at the end of the array and unshift at the beginning

of the array, and so again what we want to add here now

is to add just another stage, so very similar

to what we have down here.<br /><br />
So match and then secretTour, not equal to true.<br /><br />
Give it a save, and so this piece of code here basically

is exactly what we have up here right?

Basically removing from the output all the documents

that have secretTour set to true, right?

So if you give it a save now, then let's check this out,

and remember we have now 11 tours, four, four,

and three so let's check the result afterwards

and so now indeed one of the difficult yours is gone

so we only now have three difficult tours meaning

that we are back to just having 10.<br /><br />
Okay and actually we can confirm that our super secret tour

was a difficult tour, alright and so that is now gone

and so our results are now only about the regular

non-secret tours alright?

And we can again take a look at our aggregation pipeline now

and here you see that now we have these two matched stages.<br /><br />
Great and as I mentioned before it's no problem

to repeat these stages, we can have as many match stages

as we want, okay and that's it for aggregation middleware.<br /><br />
I'm not gonna include any post code here for middleware

that's not really necessary alright,

and I'm also not gonna talk about model middleware here

because it's really not that important.<br /><br />
Alright, so middleware is some really cool

and important stuff that we can add to our models,

and there is indeed other cool stuff

that we can do with models, for example implementing

instance methods which are methods that will be available

on ever document after being queried,

and that again can be quite handy,

and we will do that later

in the authentication section as well okay.<br /><br />
So I'm gonna leave that for a bit later,

now what we are gonna do in this section

just to finish is to actually add some validation, alright

and so in the next two videos we're gonna talk about that.
