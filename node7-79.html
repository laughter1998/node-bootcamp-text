    Now instead of using the terminal

to work with MongoDB, we can also use an app

with a graphical user interface that MongoDB

provides us which is called Compass.<br /><br />
So let's now go ahead and download the Compass application.<br /><br />
So if you still have the page open where we downloaded

MongoDB in one of the first lectures,

you can download the Compass app right from here.<br /><br />
Okay, so it's then tools and Compass.<br /><br />
All right, and if you just opened up the MongoDB website

for the first time, then just come to products

and down here, you have MongoDB Compass.<br /><br />
Okay, now just download the stable version

at your time of recording then choose your platform

which in my case is Mac OS and then just download.<br /><br />
Now in order to download Compass,

you will need to give MongoDB some

information about you but it's really worth it,

and so I see no problem in doing that.<br /><br />
I'm not gonna do it here right now

because I already have Compass on my computer.<br /><br />
Okay, so just pause the video at this point,

fill this form then download the installator

and install it on your computer.<br /><br />
Then after that, come back to this video

to get started with Compass.<br /><br />
So when you open up the Compass application,

it should look something like this.<br /><br />
So right away, you should be on the screen

for creating a new connection, okay?

And if you're not then just head over here

to the left side and click new connection.<br /><br />
You might also have some window with some tips

that opens up the first time when you open Compass

but you can just close that away.<br /><br />
Okay, so that you get to this screen.<br /><br />
Now in order to create a connection to your local database,

make sure you have the Mongo server

running in the background, so just to make sure,

open up this process here and then here make sure

that it's still working so that it's still

on the default port of 27017.<br /><br />
Okay and so if you get back here, you actually already

have that automatically fill in for you.<br /><br />
So the Hostname is by default Localhost

and the port is 27017 just like we saw in our Mongo server.<br /><br />
Right, and so you actually do not have to fill anything,

all we have to do is to click connect.<br /><br />
All right, and so right away, here you see

all the databases that we locally have on our computer.<br /><br />
So here in this nice list and also here on the left side.<br /><br />
So, just to make sure that this is correct,

let's go to our terminal here and write,

well after deleting this here of course,

let's write show dbs and indeed these are the exact

same for databases that I have in Compass.<br /><br />
And again, don't worry if yours

are not exactly the same, as long as

you have the natours test databased in there, you're fine.<br /><br />
Okay, so we open that up

and so we have our tours collection.<br /><br />
And you can also see it here on the left side.<br /><br />
So if we open that up now, then in there

we have the two documents that we created before

in the Mongo shell right, so let's create a new one,

let's give it a name, and let's use again

The Forest Hiker, which is the one that we deleted

in the previous lecture, all right hit return,

which will then open a new line.<br /><br />
Let's set the price to 297, all right?

And when I was here I just hit tab

to then define the value, okay,

and then again return, rating, tab

and 4.7.<br /><br />
Okay, so let's insert it, or actually we should change

this here from string to a number,

so let's say an integer

and let's say here a double, insert and here we go.<br /><br />
So just like this we created a new document.<br /><br />
And of course here in the terminal,

we can just quickly confirm that, so db.tours.find,

and here we go that's our newly created

document that we just created using Compass.<br /><br />
So Compass is really just a graphical user interface

for doing the exact same stuff that we can do here, okay.<br /><br />
But of course it was very important for us to do it in code,

because that's actually how were gonna do it later

in our express application, okay?

But of course it was still very important

to also do it in code before because then it's actually

how we will do it later in our express application.<br /><br />
Anyway, let's now go back here

and for example, edit some stuff here.<br /><br />
So we have here on the right side these buttons to edit,

and so we can simply, let's say change the price here to 997

for example, and then hit update down here and here we go.<br /><br />
We can also delete documents,

so let's get rid of the one we just did before.<br /><br />
Okay and of course we can also query for documents

and we do that up here.<br /><br />
And here we actually need to write

the kind of code that we wrote before.<br /><br />
So for example, let's search for tours

with a price less than 700.<br /><br />
And so, again that works just like

we did it before in the terminal.<br /><br />
Okay so, in the Mongo shell.<br /><br />
So, we want the price to be less than,

700.<br /><br />
And you see here that Compass actually

did a lot of auto suggestions here,

so let's see that again.<br /><br />
So it gives us right away lt and lte here.<br /><br />
And in this case, doesn't really matter.<br /><br />
So close that guy and close this one.<br /><br />
And you see that before it was red,

so meaning that the query was not valid,

and also the button was not clickable.<br /><br />
But now, when it's correct, we just need to hit return

and then it gives us all the documents that match our query.<br /><br />
In this case, it's just this one, but of course

if there were multiple, then all of them would get matched.<br /><br />
And here we could also do the project, and remember

that project means to just select some of the fields.<br /><br />
And so let's say,

name set to one, and so we only get the name now.<br /><br />
Right, remember doing that in one

of the Mongo shell lectures, okay.<br /><br />
Finally, we can then reset all of this

and get rid of our queries

and get back to our initial state.<br /><br />
And here in Compass we can really do all kinds of stuff.<br /><br />
Aggregations, define some schemas or analyze schemas,

take look at indexes and all that good stuff

that we're gonna do throughout the course.<br /><br />
Okay, so we're gonna do aggregations,

we're gonna analyze our schema, we're gonna create indexes,

we're gonna create validation and so really

as you can see there's a lot of content ahead of us.
