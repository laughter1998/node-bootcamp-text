    This video will be the first

of the four CRUD operation videos.<br /><br />
So this first one is about creating new documents.<br /><br />
But before we start creating new documents,

let me actually address a concern that you might be having.<br /><br />
So maybe you're wondering,

why are we actually doing all this stuff in a terminal?

And how does this relate to our Express application

that we built in the last section?

Well, the answer for that is that right now,

I want you to learn the absolute fundamentals of MongoDB,

without the context of any application.<br /><br />
So really, completely outside of Node.js.<br /><br />
Because in theory, we could us MongoDB

with any other language or any other framework.<br /><br />
It doesn't have to be with Node.js,

and so I think it's actually a good idea

to learn MongoDB standing completely on its own,

without the context of any other language.<br /><br />
Okay?

Later on, we will of course connect

a MongoDB database with our application,

so that in the next section,

we can then actually start working with databases

inside of our Express application.<br /><br />
And by then we will use

a MongoDB driver just for Node Express,

so that we can use our JavaScript language

to interact with our MongoDB database.<br /><br />
All right?

But for now, let's just learn MongoDB without any of that.<br /><br />
All right?

So in the last lecture, we created a new database.<br /><br />
A new collection inside, called tours,

and then one new document in there.<br /><br />
Right?

Remember that?

And to do that, we used insert 1.<br /><br />
Remember that?

But now, let's actually create

two documents at the same time.<br /><br />
So that works like this.<br /><br />
db, with just again, the current database, then .tours,

which is the collection where we want

to add our new documents, and then .insertMany.<br /><br />
Okay?

And insertMany is gonna accept an array of multiple objects.<br /><br />
So an array, and then close it.<br /><br />
So an empty object, and that may actually

put the second empty object here also already,

and so all we need to do is to fill up these objects.<br /><br />
So name, this one is called The Sea Explorer.<br /><br />
It has a price of 497, and a rating of 4.8.<br /><br />
And then the next object.<br /><br />
Let's give it a name of The Snow Adventurer.<br /><br />
Which is one of the other nine tours that we have.<br /><br />
Then the price is a bit more expensive, 997.<br /><br />
And the rating is 4.9.<br /><br />
And actually, let's add another field here.<br /><br />
So, remember from the intro lecture

how I said that MongoDB documents are very flexible.<br /><br />
And so they do not all have to have the same structure.<br /><br />
Okay?

So we can have different fields in different documents.<br /><br />
And so let's add the difficulty here.<br /><br />
And set this one to easy.<br /><br />
Okay?

So that's it, let's hit return here.<br /><br />
And so we inserted two new documents,

and here we see the IDs that they got.<br /><br />
So these two auto-generated

unique identifiers for each of them.<br /><br />
Okay?

Now just to make sure, remember make db.tours.find,

and here indeed, we now have our three tours.<br /><br />
So that's the one we created in the last lecture,

and then the two that we just created.<br /><br />
Okay?

So that's actually it for this lecture,

just to recap, we used the insertMany function

to pass in an array of two objects,

or two documents that we wanted to create.<br /><br />
Okay?

So that's all I had for this one.<br /><br />
In the next one, we will then learn how to do

some advanced queries to search for data in our database.<br /><br />
So that's an exciting one, so let's move on immediately.
